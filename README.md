Wrapper for the Java Strange Quantum Computing API to allow larger scale programs to be developed
Working on allowing integregation with the IBM Qisket so one can execute the Quantum program's developed in Java on a real quantum computer. Also working on being able to create Qisket python scripts from the Strange Quantum Circuit and vice versa.
